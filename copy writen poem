there is no future in poems
  sad, 
but true
if you hope to be 
a king..

so, instead
occasionally, seldom 
some lines get released
  into ether
bats and crows
  flocking

there is only the past in words
oh, things still get scribbled 
  on pages
  of endless books
and tick-tacked out 
  on keyboards
carried across 
   state 
   & 
   mental lines

every person is a poet
unknown, or tortured about it
if you possess written words
into the night they must go

geek poet
