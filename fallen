remember the
anticipation before
embrace

scent of chalk on the board
little memory paths
lines stretched to words
sound in old places
once filled with spaces

dilated the time line
of awkward  moments
before arms wrap
around

force equals the weight
mixed with
speed of change
basking at lights limit
or simply
falling

impact is just so
soft
almost seems like a memory
if still alive
then lucky
else not lucky

simple
