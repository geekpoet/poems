Beach

I put an apple core down
Hoping the flyes would settle
Due south on the sweet scent
No wind, just waves of water
Clouds of tooth paste, and cotton balls
Mythical,god like shafts of light
And black fly’s eye
Writer block i figure, they smell it
Perch upon me, there millions 
Of identical optical receptors
Not one wants the core ambrosia
It’s ether me, or the water
they must know
Something i don’t
And i too drink
It’s a sad day when
You fly face first
Against the waves creeping tide
Covered like elephant, mouse hippo
With moral-less, heathen fly’s
I rise, leaping waves scatter against the rocks
I slop up the way i came
And go home to sleep away the day
Maybe i’ll think of something
To write about tomorrow
