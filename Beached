Beached

I put an apple core down
Hoping the flys would settle
Due south on the sweet scent
No wind, just waves of water
Clouds of tooth paste
Mythical shunts of heaven’s doormat 
And black flys eyes
Writers block i figure, they smell it
Perching upon me, there millions 
Of identical optical receptors
Always peering
Not one wants the core ambrosia
It’s me or the water’s edge
I sit still hoping i become just 
Another rock to erode away
But the whispering of their wings
Sounds like the shells breath
Beckons for the water’s line
It is a sad day when
You fly face first
Against the waves creeping tide
Covered like elephant, moose, hippo
With moral-less, heathens
Pulling up at the very last moment
And settling back as the tide swoops out 
I rise, droplets scatter against the rocks
I sloped back up the way i came
Leaving the pen and paper
Let the flies try and write this poem
