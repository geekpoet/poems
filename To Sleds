to Sleds to Sleds to Sleds
a race to slide, or a glide upon
the whitest of delights
not only do we embrace, bravely I might add
we race faster, we fly farther to be the 
first to reach the bridge, or beyond
but please, not the lake

to sleds to sleds to sleds
more the just speed alone
we also try to pack the most
people on a sled
the most piled, the highest pile, the longest pile
all number are welcome here

to sleds to sleds to sleds
a private luge for our spirits to chase us down
as the crashings and smashings barely beware
as those upon snow couches, simply cheer and stare
candles on ice tables, night spent slipping
quickly to the lodge

to sleds to sleds to sleds
all around the year you can hear
the echoes of the cheers, of sleds and sleding
the praises sung, the siren becaon
and promises of many slippings in the nights
of course there are many feasts
and often a woodland, or other beast
treats and sweets with a long river of cafe
can hardly delay the rise and fall
of sleds, sleds, sleds
