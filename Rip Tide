the honeymooners
got away with it
made off with the safe
broke open the laugh track
even if it wasn't ever funny

cycles can't rinse us clean
karma can't track us all down
santa's list can't play catch up fast enough
to list all of the sinners
to list all of gods children

in those moments
when all else around seemed
  silent
when the tide was away
the chimes would crash
  tooth to flesh
gnash

it
was in their home
the surfacing tension
the bad decisions
the egging on
for moons passing on by
sloshing
back and forth
across
the carpet
the oceans
now
  a cigarette
  a fag
  a loose canon
  a single phone call
out in the open
like beach glass
polished
  by grit
  by gravel

got caught
back turned
unaware
cause it only happens
  in the movies
  in tv episodes
to others

not anymore

we all grow up
towards ideals
  winds
  parents
  towels
  fists
out side the vacuum
our experience
twists inside
knocks down
crumples spirit

there is no excuse
there is no predication
there is nothing but
  shame
  slurs
  regrets
fear
