America we need to talk
We the people have been on a dark road
For too long
The light that is around the corner
Always seems just too far off

We the people have fought each other
A bit
We the people have reached our tentacles
into those the people
A lot

Right now a darkness is deeply within
Us
without the light
without a Beacon
us wandering
amidst the 
mists of our own exhaustion
turns we upon us

A hint of hint day can emerge
from we 
the people

ask questions
Hard tough questions
What is
  A inalienably right
  A terrorist
  A patriot
  A flag
  A citizen 

symbols and words
Are not enough
actions of helping, of empathy 
of kindness

We the people have
   Questions
   Puzzles
   Riddles
   Smiles
enough to last to the end

Let the walls of our houses strip away
Let the borders in our mind
in our maps
expand
Let us the people put ourselves out there
Talk across our ideology
  Religion
  Color
  Size
  Shape
  Sex
  Origin
  Party

We the people will get sicker. Sadder 
If we turn full into the night
If we hide our desires
If we deny others dreams
If we the people stay silent

Problems are riddles
Problems are constant
Problems are human

Crosses, stars, geometry, God
All stand in the way
History and complacency
Are the evils of we the people

America we can do better
We the people are best when we mix words with action
And leave the
  Credit card
  Green paper
  Egos
At home

There is but this one small world
We the people stand at the bottom of a vast ocean of air
Let the currents carry us
Let the words flow
Let the robes of traditional become thread bare
We the people can make more

Our answer is in hope that question  will catch fire
Lead to more questions

Knowledge is not wisdom
only faith is not practical
mix morals with truths
A cocktail that tastes sublime
With ice cubes and smiles

America we are the people
And we are mighty
when we let ourselves 
when we don't hold back
when we lean in with smiles and hope

be curious.
