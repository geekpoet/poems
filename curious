America we need to talk
We the people have been on a dark road
For too long
The light that is around the corner
Always seems just too far off

We the people have fought each other
A bit
We the people have reached out our tentacles into those the people
A lot

Right now the darkness is deeply within
Us
And without the light, without a. Beacon
We are wandering
Amidst the mist

A hint of day must emerge from we the people
To ask questions
Hard tough questions
What is
  A inalienably right
  A terrorist
  A patriot
  An flag

Symbols and words
Are not enough
We the people need to want more
More
  Questions
  Puzzles
  Riddles
  Smiles

Let the walls of our houses strip. Away
Let us the people out ourselves out there
Talk across our ideology
  Religion
  Color
  Size
  Shape
  Sex
  Origin

We the people will get sicker. Sadder
If we turn full into the night
If we hide our desire a
If we the people stay silent

Problems are riddles
Problems are constant
Problems are humans

Crosses, stars, geometry, God
All stand in the way
History and complacency
Are the evils of we the people

America can do better
We the people are best when we mix words with action
And leave the
  Credit card
  Green paper
  Egos
At home

There is but one world
We the people stand at the bottom of a vast ocean of air
Let the currents carry us
Let the words flow
Let the robes of traditional become thread bare
We the people can make more

Out answer is in hope that question will catch fire
Lead to more questions

Knowledge is not wisdom
But faith is not practical
We must mix morals with truth
A cocktail that tastes sublime
With some ice cubes and smiles

America we are the people
And we are mighty if we let ourselves
If we don't hold back
If we lean in with smiles and hope

be curious.
