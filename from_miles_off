From miles off

she had just finished fetching her distant smile
eyes displaced from what she looked at
his head lowered to half mast
the moment of the 
last consonant  had ended
waves rippled in the puddles as he dragged his heal across
the pavement
it was the plane coming from miles off that mattered now
‘o..uuh..’
a vowel is the open air stream from the lungs
‘k, bye’
a consonant is the broken arm of the vowel
‘yeah, bye’
he turned down to the left onto the railroad tracks
she migrated south
it was the plane coming from miles off that mattered now
sometimes the vibration of a train can shunt up the spine
through the foot
as the stampede of buffalo rolled
he balanced on a beam
it was the plane coming from miles off that mattered now
the propeller beat of his heart sulking across her memory
she only a few fettered feet away
memory clods pushing their way through the 
engine valves of his mind
the clank of the train, the whirl of the wings
it was the plane coming from mile off that mattered now
wing span breathing heavy sighs 
a unsung commie-kasei-enemy for a pilot
under it’s belly tucked H and A bombs
only a blip on the radar, unnoticeable
 but out on the streets 
the approach sent walls of sounds across car hoods
into bails bonds offices
right through the railway station
it was the plane coming from miles off that mattered now
he stood on one leg, imagined the train steaming down
closed one eye and then the next
inhaled a long breath, waited it out
it was the plane coming from miles off that mattered now
bang, across the station the h bomb hit
the shock of the first wave rushed across him
pushed his body clear of the train
and was it not for reflexes
he would of stayed down
left the memories to the cows
it was the plane coming from miles off that mattered now
and he saw it for the first time
wild, colored, lucid and approaching
eye matching the sky wideness
he gawked as he ran
straight into it’s path
it was the plane coming from miles off that mattered now
A bomb dropped, and he was down
She was south for the winter
Unavailable for comment

leaking gas range
but the steel railway didn’t matter
lovers and killers carried to and fro
bowed his head
only a blip almost unnoticeable on radar
out on the street
