From mile off

she had just finished fetching the distant smile
her eyes displaced from what she looked at
he lowered his head
the moment of the
last consonant  had ended
waves rippled in the puddles as he dragged his heal across
the pavement

it was the plane coming from miles off that mattered now

‘o..uuh..’
a vowel is the open air stream from the lungs
‘k, bye’
a consonant is the broken arm of the vowel
‘yeah, bye’
he turned down to the left onto the railroad tracks
she migrated south

it was the plane coming from miles off that mattered now

sometimes the vibration of a train can shunt up the spine
through the foot
as the stampede of buffalo rolled
he balanced on a beam

it was the plane coming from miles off that mattered now

the propeller beat of his heart sulking across her memory
she only a few fettered feet away
memory clods pushing their way though the engine valves
of his mind
the clank of the train, the whirl of the wings

it was the plane coming from mile off that mattered now

wing span breathing heavy sighs
a unsung commie-kamazi-enimie for a pilot
under it belly tucked H and A bombs
only a blip on the radar, unnoticeable
but out on there on the  street
the approach sent walls of sounds across car hoods
into bail bonds offices
right through that railway station

it was the plane coming from miles off that mattered now

he stood on one leg, imagined the train steaming down
closed one eye and then the next
inhaled a long breath, waited
as it flowed out

it was the plane coming from miles off that mattered now

bang, across the station the H bomb hit
the shock of the first wave rushed across him
pushed his body clear of the train
and was it not for reflexes
he would of stayed down
left the memories to the cows

it was the plane coming from miles off that mattered now

and then he saw it
saw the plane for the first time
wild, colored, lucid and approaching
eye matching the sky wideness
he gawked as he ran
straight into the path

it was the plane coming from miles off that mattered now

the A bomb hit him
dead on
and he went down
She was south for the winter
