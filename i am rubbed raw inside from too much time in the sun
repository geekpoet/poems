I am rubbed raw inside from too much time in the sun

during this sudden storm
I saw a rainbow that stayed
but never quite connected
also this hour under pressure
of power
sudden surrender to the white hot heat
of passion of memories
of things that missed and thing that hit
you go bump in this night 
alone or at least with out me
I know so much is beyond even me
that god is still god
and you are more lovely than any ode
I can every make
I issue you my left arm
I issue you me right arm
I issue you the legs and the stars
and every cell in-between
I worship silly pleasure
I miss the mark
I am not arrows
I fly no kites
and still I think you like me
even when common winds blow
skirts hair and bodies
you say hello and good bye
and you say hello and I say good bye
and all I want to say is I love you
but I am stubborn bullheaded pig hearted and stupid
stupid on love and stupid for the moon
stupid to much of the time
call me this night
call me this night
make me an offer
make me an offer
I offer me 
elevator hits the top floor
downtown
the middle of the night
stepping out into the star light night
then 60 cycle hum of every past lover
every single kiss
every single star is in your eyes
the cars that are left behind from the rush hour madness
are collecting dew
are collecting dust
you stroke the cold metal of a red WV
breath into its window and write
good bye
stepping onto the edge of the building
you peer down into the asphalt
freedom flies like the bag lady on the ice
like you streaming across the horizon
like you imagining the water
like you imagining the winds wild ways
so say it and say it tonight
till then all else has failed
walk down to the asphalt
kiss its cold black edges with you smile
steal me this dream
steal me this under garment
steal me this
