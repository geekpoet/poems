wary goes the flesh to light
  turned over
  forced red

while most remain
  in beneath the cool
  slices of silicon
  curves of steal
  breath of cloud

summertime means
  we can cast a shadow again
  roll down the windows
  let loose the winter elbow

sputtering along
in time with the radio

it is a dance above us
ringed in lamp light
universal
beacons
it to will pass
