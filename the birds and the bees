it was one of those days
that i am lucky enough to remember
not individually
like a car accident like a heart attack
nope
i remember this day more like
  a tangle of hair, sedimentary layers
  a fuzzy photocopy of an old photograph

this day was early summer
flowers were fully engorged by the sun's presence
birds arriving in full force
ants on long procession lines
bees a lite upon the brewing breeze
the west coast as a whole
was just hitting it's stride in mellowing out

this day was different because the birds needed a new home
this day was the  same because the pool needed skimming
this day was different because the bees needed moving
this day was the  same because the humans were cannon balls

but mostly this day
was when the conversation pool side
was cross generational
was about the basics
was between friends

was about the literal
birds and bees
